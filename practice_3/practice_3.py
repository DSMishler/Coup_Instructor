Instructions:
    - Copy this whole file into your own directory
    - Remove the instructor's name from the top and place your name
        - do the same with creation date
    - Follow the problem specifications that follow and make a python
      document that can run without any errors
    - If you want some extra practice, proceed to the extra practice document
    - For a hope score, push your homework to github by Sunday at 8:00 PM
        - If you submit after that, it's fine, but you get 0 marks if
          I grade and don't find your homework
