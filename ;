## 1v1 Play

### Do players get to both block and challenge?

No, if a player is faced with an action that they can either block *or*
challenge, they must choose one, not both.


## Group Play

### What if two players each want to simultaneously block/challenge an action?

If a player takes an action, each player is individually (and secretly)
asked whether they want to block or challenge. If two players want to
challenge, say, then one of the two players is chosen at random. The
player who didn't get selected - no one will even know he tried to challenge.
