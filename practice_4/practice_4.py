# problem 1
# After any action occurs, add something to determine whether it is
# challenge-able.
# Note: the following actions are *not* challenge-able
    # income
    # foreign aid
    # coup
    # challenge


# problem 2
# Add a step in your game master class that asks each player whether that
# player wishes to challenge a given action. Once that is done, randomly
# select from the players who returned "challenge" and broadcast that the
# action was challenged.


# problem 3
# Add a helper function that takes an action as an argument and returns
# the card(s) in an array (possibly of length 1) that are necessary to
# win a challenge over that action
# If you'd rather make a global dictionary instead, do that. If you don't
# know what I mean by that, stick with the function.



# problem 4
# When a player is challenged, have that player reveal a card. If that
# card is incorrect, that player discards that card. If that card is correct,
# force the challenging player to discard a card.



# problem 5
# Repeat problems 1-4 for blocking, *noting* that blocking is always
# challengeable! And... don't hesitate to ask me for help.
# The blocking problem is *challenging*.
